## The aim of this code is to seperate trials in a vr session into what strategy the animal is using:
# 1. run throughs                       / stops =0
# 2. inefficient successful strategy    / stops > 0 in and outside RZ  
# 3. efficient successful strategy      / stops > 0 in RZ
# 4. failing                            / stops > 0 outside RZ


# the output of this code is an array, the same size as binned data (trials x location bins) with a tag as to what strategy is used on that trial
