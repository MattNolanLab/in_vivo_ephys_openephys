%	
%	A script which analyses grid cell autocorrelograms and outputs several commonly used grid field measures.
%
%	Input:
%	amap = the autocorrelation matrix for processing
%	binsize = the bin size (cm) used to create the original firing rate map
%
%	Output:
%		Grid score:
%		Defined by Krupic, Bauza, Burton, Barry, O'Keefe (2015) as the difference between the minimum correlation coefficient for autocorrelogram 
%		rotations of 60 and 120 degrees and the maximum correlation coefficient for autocorrelogram rotations of 30, 90 and 150 degrees.
%		This score can vary between -2 and 2, although generally values above below -1.5 or above 1.5 are uncommon
%
%		Grid spacing/wavelength:
%		Defined by Hafting, Fyhn, Molden, Moser, Moser (2005) as the distance from the central autocorrelogram peak to the vertices of the inner 
%		hexagon in the autocorrelogram (the median of the six distances). 
%		This should be in cm.
%
%		Field Size:
%		Defined by Wills, Barry, Cacucci (2012) as the square root of the area of the central peak of the autocorrelogram divided by pi.
%		This should be in cm2
%
%		Grid orientation:
%		Defined by Hafting, Fyhn, Molden, Moser, Moser (2005) as the angle between a camera-defined reference line (0 degrees or x axis) 
%		and a vector to the nearest vertex of the inner hexagon in the counterclockwise direction
%		This is in degrees and can vary between 0 and 59 (after 59 a new field should emerge at 0 if its a grid cell);
%
%		Ellipticity/eccentricity:
%		As measured by Krupic, Bauza, Burton, Barry, O'Keefe (2015) by fitting an ellipse to the six central peaks of the local spatial 
%		autocorrelogram using a least squares method. Eccentricity e was used as a measure of ellipticity (with 0 indicating a perfect 
%		circle): e = sqrt(1 - (b^2/a^2)) where a and b are the major and minor axis lengths respectively
%		This varies between 0 and 1; 0 is the ellipticity of a perfect circle, 1 is the ellipticity of a parabola
