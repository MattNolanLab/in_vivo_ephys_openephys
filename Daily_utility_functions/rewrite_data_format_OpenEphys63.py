This script enables quick writing of the parameter file for all recordings
provided the vr and open field recordings are in seperate folders within sub folders named either "vr" or "of"

a parameter helped csv file much be written with headings such as mouse_id, training_day and other optional parameters to be added 
such as track_length and stop_threshold
